 # Netflix Movies & TV Shows Tableau Dashboard

## Project Description

This Tableau dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of Netflix's movies and TV shows, showcasing their distribution by country, genre, ratings, and release years. It offers insights into content trends and viewer preferences through various visualizations including maps, bar charts, and bubble charts.

## Steps to Build the Dashboard (with Visuals)

### 1. Data Collection

The project begins with downloading a Netflix dataset (CSV) containing details such as title, type (movie/TV show), genre, release year, rating, duration, country, and date added.

---

### 2. Data Preparation

Clean and preprocess the dataset using Excel or Tableau Prep:
- Remove missing values and duplicates.
- Standardize genres and ratings for consistency.
- Split multi-genre entries so a movie/TV show can be counted under all applicable genres.

---

### 3. Import into Tableau

Connect Tableau Desktop to your cleaned dataset and check that all fields are correctly recognized.
